# create two simple SPA project (one with Angular and one with React) with shared backend server with at least one Get and one Delete request.


Since you know both Angular and React, (I am not sure which one you are going to use in the next project here) 
I want to kindly ask you create two simple SPA project (one with Angular and one with React) with shared backend server with at least one Get and one Delete request.

Please mind these:
Use Router and have at least 2 different routes
Show 2 list of items which you get from API call and you could select and move items between these lists
You could move items one by one, move all at once, and by dragging one item and dropping in another list ( or dropping and change the order of an item in its own list)
Use Redux or some other state management
Being responsive
And you could delete items
Show success message on successful delete

** It would be great if you could have login/logout (Using JWT) in your project as well (If you have enough time for this)

Feel free to reach me anytime in case you have question 
Best Regards

Technical Assignment at mobileLIVE
Simple SPA 
React Redux

Monday, Aug 26, 2019 to Friday, Aug 30, 2019

- [x] Use Router and have at least 2 different routes
- [ ] Show 2 list of items which you get from API call and you could select and move items between these lists
- [ ] You could move items one by one, move all at once, and by dragging one item and dropping in another list ( or dropping and change the order of an item in its own list)
- [x] Use Redux or some other state management
- [x] Being responsive
- [x] And you could delete items
- [x] Show success message on successful delete
- [ ] BONUS ** It would be great if you could have login/logout (Using JWT) in your project as well (If you have enough time for this)
 I also have done:
- [x] Create React App
- [x] Allow users to click on "Edit" to route to a different page

Still need to do:
- [ ] shared backend server with at least one Get and one Delete request (possibly only do front end so don't need this)
- [ ] Angular? (If project is in React, then don't this either)

Feedback:
Wed Aug 28 We still need:
- [x] Move the List component out of Home, into it's own component, so that we can use it for the other List.
- [x] Make two columns next to each other
- [x] Fix the Delete so the alert of success shows after the item has been deleted
Thurs Aug 29
- [x] To select which list you want to add the item to - Reducer, Action
Fri Aug 30
- [x] let’s drop drag and drop now (no more drag and drop)
- [x] you could add checkboxes beside your list
- [x] and one more button named move
- [ ] Make the move button functional
- [x] so you can select from list one and move them all once to list 2
- [ ] and vs

To do:
- [x]  Let user choose which list to add items to - list 1 or 2?
- [ ] Move between the two lists

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
