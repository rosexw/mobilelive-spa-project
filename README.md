# Create a simple SPA project with lists

This project is a simple Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to add to two lists, delete items, and move items between the lists. It uses React and Redux for state management. 

Users can:
- choose which list to add item to
- select all of one list to add to the other list
- go to a new route when they edit an item or find more details about the item.
- see a responsive mobile/tablet view or desktop view
- delete items, get a warning, and receive a successful message upon deletion.


Since you know both Angular and React, (I am not sure which one you are going to use in the next project here) 
I want to kindly ask you create two simple SPA project (one with Angular and one with React) with shared backend server with at least one Get and one Delete request.
